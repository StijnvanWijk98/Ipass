# Ipass
This repository is used in my HBO-ICT Ipass project. This is my final project of my first year in computer science.
The repository includes the application and libraries made for my project.

# How to use?
1. First make sure you have hwlib and bmptk installed, don't have it? 
You can find the hwlib here:https://github.com/wovo/hwlib, and the bmptk here: https://github.com/wovo/bmptk
2. Clone this library
3. You have all the tools ready!

# Doxygen
For every library there is a Doxygen, here you can find all the features that the library includes.

# Physics
The mathematics of the 2D physics are thanks to Ruben Vink. 

P.S. In the main from every library you can find some function calls to show some of the basic possibilities of the libraries.
